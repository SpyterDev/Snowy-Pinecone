# Important!!!

Snowy Pinecone is broken!!! It only assembles the first instruction then fails to assemble the rest!!!
Snowy Pinecone is also outdated, messy and buggy. It is here for historical purposes. 
Use the newer (and improved) Winter Pinecone (https://github.com/SpyterDev/Winter-Pinecone).

# What is Snowy Pinecone?

Snowy Pinecone is a basic White Pine assembler written in C.
There are a *couple of problems with it. That is mainly because I tried making it without any knowledge of how a compiler or assembler works.
In fact, there is no tokinizer or lexical anaylsis. Snowy Pinecone will probably get rewritten properly soon. 
However any White Pine assembly will be assembled regardless!

## Just for fun!

### Why is the assembler called Snowy Pinecone?

The assembler was originally going to be called just "Pinecone." This is a White Pine assembler so it makes sense for the assembler to be called Pinecone (White Pine trees have pinecones).
However, there were many projects on GitHub named Pinecone, so I decided to add Snowy at the beginning because white pine trees grow in area that can snow (it's an evergreen after all).
